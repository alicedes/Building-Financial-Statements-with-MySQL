# Building Financial Statements with MySQL

## Introduction

This project focuses on building Profit and Loss (P&L) and Balance Sheet (B/S) statements using MySQL queries and stored procedures. The objective is to analyze the financial performance of a company, demonstrate balance in accounting records, and assess the cash flow situation to identify bankruptcy risks.

## Overview

- Access to an existing Accounting Database will be provided (read-only) to the team.
- MySQL queries and stored procedures will be used to generate P&L and B/S statements for a specified year.
- The following tasks will be accomplished:
  1. Receive the year for which the user wants to produce the P&L and B/S.
  2. Calculate net profit or loss for the specified year.
  3. Integrate the P&L value into the B/S.
  4. Ensure that Assets (A) = Liabilities (L) + Equity (E) to demonstrate balanced accounting records.
  5. Print both the P&L and B/S statements.
  6. Show the percentage change vs. the previous year for every major line item on the P&L and B/S.
  7. Analyze the monthly cash flow to assess bankruptcy risks.

## Key Components

### Data Analysis and Reporting

- Utilize MySQL queries to calculate financial metrics and perform data analysis.
- Generate reports to present P&L, B/S, and cash flow analysis.
- Include percentage change calculations for major line items to track financial performance over time.

## Usage

1. Access the existing Accounting Database provided to the team.
2. Execute the MySQL stored procedures to generate P&L and B/S statements for a specified year.
3. Review the generated reports and analyze financial performance and cash flow risks.
4. Make necessary adjustments or recommendations based on the analysis findings.

## Conclusion

Building financial statements with MySQL allows for comprehensive analysis of a company's financial performance, balance sheet integrity, and cash flow situation. By leveraging stored procedures and SQL queries, teams can gain valuable insights into the company's financial health and make informed decisions to mitigate risks and optimize performance.
